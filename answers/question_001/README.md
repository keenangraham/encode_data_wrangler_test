The authors report their experiments with two emerging infectious yeast strains, *Candida auris* and *Candida haemulonii*, isolated from hospitalized patients. While phenotypically difficult to differentiate in most clinical laboratories, the researchers find that *C. auris*, when compared to *C. haemulonii*, demonstrates a more robust heat tolerance during incubation, a greater virulence in infected mice, and a higher activity in transporting antifungal molecules out of the cell. Furthermore, they find that *C. haemulonii* is most often isolated from peripheral wound sites, while *C. auris* is most often isolated from the bloodstream. Most effectively highlighting the difference between the two strains is the finding that only 20% of mice survive inoculation with *C. auris*, while 100% of mice survive inoculation with *C. haemulonii*. The authors express their concern with this fact, given that most diagnostic laboratories misidentify *C. auris* as *C. haemulonii*, since *C. auris* is not in the database of automatic yeast identification platforms. They conclude that greater suspicion for *C. auris* is warranted, especially when a laboratory diagnosis of *C. haemulonii* is presumed.
