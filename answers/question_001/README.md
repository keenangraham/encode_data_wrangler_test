The authors report their experiments with two emerging infectious yeast strains, *Candida auris* and *Candida haemulonii*, isolated from hospitalized patients. While phenotypically difficult to differentiate in most clinical laboratories, the researchers find that *C. auris* demonstrates a more robust heat tolerance during incubation, a greater virulence in infected mice, and a higher activity in transporting antifungal molecules out of the cell.
